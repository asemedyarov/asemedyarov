[Speedgoat](https://www.speedgoat.com) test systems are ideal for rapidly and continuously prototyping control designs and thoroughly testing embedded controllers with digital twins.

Frequent use cases include designing and testing control designs and embedded controllers at the full system, power system, and power electronics levels, such as the [electrification](https://www.speedgoat.com/solutions/testing-workflows/electrification-of-everything) of [vehicles](https://www.speedgoat.com/solutions/industries/automotive), [aircrafts](https://www.speedgoat.com/solutions/industries/aerospace), and [renewable energies](https://www.speedgoat.com/solutions/industries/power-systems/microgrids-and-renewables), for [medical devices](https://www.speedgoat.com/solutions/industries/medical-devices), and more [autonomous robotics](https://www.speedgoat.com/solutions/industries/robotic-and-autonomous-systems).

All Speedgoat systems provide unrivaled workflow integration with MATLAB¬Æ and Simulink¬Æ and can also be instrumented through MATLAB¬Æ App Designer deployed standalone graphical user interfaces and XIL interfaced test automation software environments enabled by [Simulink¬Æ Real-Time‚Ñ¢](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-real-time.html).

Some Speedgoat systems are also ideal to leverage as embedded controllers.

### ‚úÖ Testing Workflows‚Äã
Rapidly prototype control designs by applying [rapid control prototyping](https://www.speedgoat.com/solutions/testing-workflows/rapid-control-prototyping), test embedded controllers with
[hardware-in-the-loop](https://www.speedgoat.com/solutions/testing-workflows/hardware-in-the-loop) simulation of digital twins, and leverage Speedgoat systems as embedded controllers.
